 Requirement


 /datums-for-stage
 A ConversionGroup that converts a level or stage property
  shall include a definition of the vertical datum used.




 Requirement


 /multiple-conversion-types
 Conversions shall support conversion between any properties,
  not just stage-flow conversions.




 Requirement


 /start-periods
 Within a ConversionGroup, each ConversionPeriod shall express
  the start date of a period of application for a Conversion. The end of the
  applicable period may be specified using the periodEnd. If no end is
  specified for the ConversionPeriod, the conversion applies to the start of
  the next applicable period, or indefinitely if no other ConversionPeriods
  exist in the ConversionGroup. 




 Requirement


 /conversion-reuse
 Different ConversionPeriods shall be able to refer to the same
  Conversion. 




 Requirement


 /conversion-gaps
 To express a gap in groups of Conversions, a ConversionPeriod
  with a periodEnd shall be used, followed by a ConversionPeriod with
  periodStart to express the end of the gap. 




 Requirement


 /linear-interpolation
 A ConversionTable shall contain sufficient input/output values
  to allow linear interpolation between points. The data producer determines
  the resolution at which the values are created.




 Requirement


 /equation
 A Conversion shall support specification of the source
  equation of the conversion table. This shall be done using the
  sourceDefinition property to  reference
  a ConversionEquation. The ConversionEquation supports a text-based equation
  description. There is no equation formatting specified. 




 Requirement


 /transformation
 The definition of a Conversion shall be sufficient to allow
  calculation of derived values, without the need to specify the way the
  transformation should be run.




 Requirement


 /source-system
 A Conversion definition shall support additional information that
  describes how the source system stored the conversion table. This shall be
  done using the sourceDefinition property. 




 Requirement


 /keys
 A ConversionGroup shall be uniquely identified by, at a
  minimum, the Monitoring Point, inputProperty and outputProperty. If
  additional key entries are required, these can be expressed using the 'name'
  property.




 Requirement


 /link-to-gaugings
 A Conversion shall allow referencing to the gauging
  observations that were used in construction of the conversion relationship
  through the ConversionMetadata type. This allows the following to be defined:
·      Gauging observations that were used and taken
  in the period of application; 
·      Gauging observations that were not used in
  the period of application; 
·      Gauging observation that were used but taken
  outside the application period, e.g. a high flow rating conversion. 




 Requirement


 /phasing
 A ConversionGroup shall support the definition of a phased
  changed between Conversions. Each ConversionPeriod shall specify the period
  over which the applicable Conversion should be phased from the previous
  Conversion.




 Requirement


 /table-point-quality
 A ConversionTable shall support expression of the quality of
  each point within the table. A default shall be provided for the whole table,
  unless overridden by individual points. To override the default, the input
  and output values provide a SWE:Quantity type that allows a quality to be
  specified against a quantity.




 Requirement


 /review-process-metadata
 A Conversion shall contain metadata properties to support
  definition of whether the conversion is under review, approved or in
  development.




 Requirement


 /range-group
 A Conversion shall contain an associated with a RangeGroup,
  which describes metadata that varies according to the inputProperty.Requirements Class

 Requirement


 /range-values
 A range group shall contain multiple RangeTables, which define
  metadata that changes with the input property. 




 Requirement


 /start-end-value
 Range tables shall contain a start and end value for which the
  specified metadata is valid.Requirements Class
  



  http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/part2/1.0/req/uml-gaugings
  



 Requirement


 /observed-property
 The observed property of the OM_Observation type shall be a composite
  property that includes both the inputProperty and outputProperty. E.g. a
  stage to discharge definition. 




 Requirement


 /result-type
 A GaugingObservation shall have a result property (from
  OM_Observation) that contains two scalar values: the observed inputProperty
  and outputProperty.




 Requirement


 /feature-of-interest
 The feature of interest of a Gauging Observation shall be a
  MonitoringPoint (from WaterML2.0 part 1).Requirements Class

Requirement


 /geometry-observation
A
  section observation shall be an OM_GeometryObservation with a result type of
  that is a sub-class of GM_Object. 




 Requirement


 /observed-property
The
  observedProperty of the OM_GeometryObservation shall refer to the type of
  section that is being observed (e.g. river cross-section) using a controlled
  vocabulary.Requirements
